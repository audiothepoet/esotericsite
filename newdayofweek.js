Loves content\n, Builds its own monument,\n, And carves above its vaulted tomb\n, The Phoenix on her fiery plume,\n, To their own souls to testify\n, Their kisses immortality."+"</font>")

Spinning shallowly it thinks of shallow outer space. Europa wets its ankles and is in pain. The pain orbits around Jupiter. Europa hurts. It spins until it forgets Jupiter and thinks of the moment it spun around someone who wasn't there. It's space and space smiles like a doll whose neck is the only part that turns. When Europa thinks of space it thinks of the year 5000 or just before the year 5000 or just after the year 5000. It thinks of a star orbiting a faraway star. It writes down a date it can't live in and writes a diary entry where the letters orbit around letters. The spinning makes them round . The left side of the doll's face is spinning to arrive at its right side. It smiles from ear to ear as its neck becomes bright blue. A letter came from far away. A letter without an orbit. Every letter in it is a round fence. A bug smoothly steps over the back of another bug. Pushing forward a little at a time. It erects the walls it has passed behind it and spins.
